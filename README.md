# SSIMA 2018 tutorial: Deep learning for segmentation in medical images
# Example of vessel segmentation from retinal images

Benjamin Irving, 2018


## Tutorials

See the Jupyter notebooks for setup and segmentation tutorial:

Tutorial 1 - Setup  

Tutorial 2 - Retina vessel segmentation  

# Code

Convert the dataset:  
`create_dataset.py`  
Train the model and test on an independent dataset:  
`train-and-predict.py`  


## Usage

Either go through the tutorials and run the code snippets in jupyter notebook or run the code directly.  

## NB

- **The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate U-Net deep networks using the slightly toy example of retinal vessel segmentation. There are probably simpler methods and networks that will be as effective for this problem but I wanted to demonstrate a deeper network**
- **For homework, the user can try and simplify this network to a much smaller version that can be trained on the cpu**
